# Tenant Dashboard Walkthrough

## What I Accomplished

1. **Dashboard Setup & Routing**:
   - Created the folder structure `app/dashboard` for the tenant dashboard.
   - Wired up route protection using [middleware.ts](file:///c:/Users/TOSHIBA/Desktop/chioma/frontend/middleware.ts). Now, anyone accessing `/dashboard` without an auth cookie is automatically redirected to the login page.
   
2. **Dashboard Layout & Navigation**:
   - Built a custom [DashboardLayout](file:///c:/Users/TOSHIBA/Desktop/chioma/frontend/components/dashboard/DashboardLayout.tsx#26-205) in [app/dashboard/layout.tsx](file:///c:/Users/TOSHIBA/Desktop/chioma/frontend/app/dashboard/layout.tsx).
   - Developed a responsive [Sidebar.tsx](file:///c:/Users/TOSHIBA/Desktop/chioma/frontend/components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx) component that features a dark `"bg-neutral-900"` theme with clean hover states and icons.
   - Kept mobile design clean by collapsing the sidebar into a hamburger menu, with the header utilizing `backdrop-blur-md` for a modern, glass feel.
   - Added a "Connect Wallet" placeholder button strictly for the authenticated tenant experience.

3. **Overview Widgets & Dashboard Page**:
   - Assembled [app/dashboard/page.tsx](file:///c:/Users/TOSHIBA/Desktop/chioma/frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx) as the main overview page.
   - Built high-fidelity information cards using Tailwind styling (`rounded-3xl shadow-sm`, `bg-emerald-50`, etc.) covering **Next Payment Due, Active Lease,** and **Rent Paid This Year**.
   - Integrated `recharts` to render a responsive micro-chart inside the "Rent Paid This Year" widget, satisfying the lightweight chart requirement.
   - Designed a modern **Active Agreements** table that scales perfectly without thick vertical borders and utilizes aesthetic status badges.

## What Was Tested

- **Typescript Compilation**: Ran `tsc` to verify that all components, including generic chart properties and Lucide React icons, had zero type errors.
- **Component Hierarchy**: Ensured that the [.tsx](file:///c:/Users/TOSHIBA/Desktop/chioma/frontend/app/page.tsx) structure uses proper Next.js `"use client"` directives appropriately where `useState` hooks are initialized (e.g. for collapsing the Sidebar).

## Validation Results

- The build steps execute cleanly. All imports resolve properly across the project.
- Next.js successfully recognizes `/dashboard` mapped under the middleware protection array.
- The UI strictly adheres to the provided design guidelines: dark sidebar, white/glass hover states, high-padding tables, and mobile stacking structure.

### Demonstration & Testing

I've tested the live UI using the automated browser system explicitly validating both desktop scaling (showing full-width layout) and mobile layouts (confirming Flex stacking and hamburger menu capability).
